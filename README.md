study-planner
===

This script will create an overview calendar with a customisable date range. I print it out in landscape on A4 paper and write my university semester due dates on it to keep me organised. It should also work for shorter school terms, trimesters, and many other cases.

Simply open studyplanner.py in a text editor, adjust the date values under `#Input parameters` to your requirements, save, make sure you have installed svgwrite, and run in the command line (or run in a Python IDE).

The output is saved to studyplanoutput.svg. To print, open the file in a web browser and print the page, or drag and drop the file to a program like MS Word.

Below is a typical output:

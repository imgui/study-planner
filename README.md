This script generates a useful piece of printable stationery that you can record your tests, assignments and due dates on. It will also work for shorter school terms, trimesters, and many other cases.

Simply open studyplanner.py in a text editor, adjust the date values under `#Input parameters` and the `ROWS_PER_CELL` value to your requirements, save, make sure you have installed svgwrite, and run in the command line (or in a Python IDE). The output is saved to studyplanoutput.svg. To print, open the file in a web browser and print the page.

Below is a typical output:
